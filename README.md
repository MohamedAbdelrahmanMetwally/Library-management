# Simple Library (Dart)

A small example project demonstrating **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Mixins**, and **Polymorphism** in Dart.  
This project simulates a minimal library system with `Book`, `Member`, `Student`, and `Librarian` classes.

##üß† Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept           | Description                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Private fields (`_field`) with getters and setters to control access          |
| **Inheritance**   | `Librarian` and `Student` both inherit from the abstract `Member` class       |
| **Mixin**         | `Logger` mixin provides a reusable `log()` method                             |
| **Polymorphism**  | Both `Librarian` and `Student` override the `borrowBook()` method differently |

## üìò Notes
<ul>
  <li>All class fields are encapsulated using private variables with proper getters and setters.</li>
  <li>The code follows clean OOP structure and is ready for GitHub publishing.</li>
  <li>You can extend it easily by adding a Library class to manage collections of books.</li>
</ul>
